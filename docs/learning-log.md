## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned how GitHub serves as a central platform for managing open source projects and tracking changes over time. I gained hands-on experience creating repositories, committing files, and understanding how version control helps maintain a clear project history. I also learned how Issues and pull requests make it easier for teams to communicate about bugs, new features, and documentation improvements. This exercise showed me why strong documentation is essential—it helps new contributors understand project structure and best practices.

## Challenges and Solutions
At first, I found it challenging to organize my repository and use Markdown effectively for README and analysis files. I reviewed GitHub’s formatting guides and practiced writing headers, links, and tables to improve readability. Another challenge was understanding how to sync local and remote repositories. By experimenting with GitHub Desktop and reviewing the commit workflow, I was able to confidently push updates and track my changes.

## Connection to My GIS Career
Learning GitHub will be extremely useful in my GIS career because many open source geospatial tools—like QGIS, GDAL, and PostGIS—are developed and managed on GitHub. These skills will help me contribute to open source projects, collaborate with other GIS professionals, and build a public portfolio that showcases my technical and analytical work.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real-world projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions through pull requests. This assignment helped me understand how those workflows build trust and transparency in the open source community, while also improving software quality through collaboration.
